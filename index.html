						<h1 class="news">Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
						<p>
							Thank you for checking out my portfolio. My name is Torin Martin, I am currently the sole developer and maintainer of <a href="https://aatracker.net">AATracker.net</a>,
							a stat tracking web app for America's Army 2.5!. The website is written using React / Reactstrap for the frontend and ASP.net Core MVC for the backend, hosted on Ubuntu using Nginx. 
							The tracking service which collects player stats is a .NET 6 application which is hosted on a CentOS 7 VPS, alongside the MongoDB database and a NodeJS Discord bot!.
							<br />
							I am currently employed as a software developer, working on data management software. My tasks have primarily revolved around bug fixes, feature implementations, and creating and maintaining a suite of automated tests for our product.
							Previously, I held a role as the sole developer of a distributed computing regression testing application for internal use amongst our team.
							I enjoy creating software using various languages, and actively develop and maintain several applications used by various online communities in my free time.
							You can read more about myself below, or check out a few projects I have worked on (along with the source code) below.
							Thank you for stopping by!.
